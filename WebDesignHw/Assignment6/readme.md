<b>T-Shirt Website<b>
I chose to create the T-shirt site. I have wanted to create a site for this for awhile and this will be a good way to start and learn how to do it. I would like the style to be fun and colorful but not so much that it hurts the eyes or is gawdy. There is a fine line between eye catching and ugly in my opinion. 
I really liked and got the hang of the background color. I don't know if I have the width option completely figured out.
I had to make some changes as I went and it is still not what I had initially expected.
I am having issues with the amount of information we have received this semester and remembering it all in oredr to put it into practice. I almost want to start over completely to make sure I did this whole thing right.
